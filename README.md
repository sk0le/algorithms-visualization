# [Algorithms Visualization](https://algorithms-visualization.amelislamovic.online/)

Algorithms are sets of instructions or processes that are followed to accomplish a task or solve a problem. They are an essential part of computer science and are used in a wide range of fields, including machine learning, data analysis, and robotics. Visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data or information. It allows us to understand and interpret complex data sets more easily by presenting them in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps. By using visualization techniques, we can gain insights, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on the data.

## [Pathfinding Visualization](https://algorithms-visualization.amelislamovic.online/pathfinding-visualization)

Part of this project demonstrates pathfinding using BFS. Users can interactively place and move start and end nodes, randomize wall placements, and initiate the pathfinding process to visualize how the algorithm navigates through the grid to find the optimal path.

## [Sorting Visualization](https://algorithms-visualization.amelislamovic.online/sorting-visualization)

 Part of this project visualizes sorting algorithms, featuring bubble sort and selection sort. Users can randomize the array, adjust the speed of the visualization, and observe the step-by-step process of how each sorting algorithm operates to arrange the array in order.
